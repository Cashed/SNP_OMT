Insurance Compliance App
========================

[Live Site](https://snp-omt.herokuapp.com/)

This is a quarter 2 full-stack group project for Galvanize.  The app adds/edits/deletes patients and generates reports reflecting Medicare and Medicaid compliance ratings for insurance companies. The d3.js API was used to populate an interactive pie chart.

### Front-End Tech Stack  
+ Templating with Jade
+ Pie chart generated with d3.js and jQuery
+ Bootstrap/CSS

### Back-End Tech Stack
+ NodeJS
+ ExpressJS
+ postgreSQL
  + KnexJS as a query builder
+ oAuth with Passport


Thoughts/Concerns/Challenges
----------------------------
+ Group Experience
  + I felt EXTREMELY blessed to be working with an amazing group of hard-working individuals
  + Separating back-end and front-end responsibilities seemed to make it harder to pull everything together.  In the future, I would like to try either experimenting with either each member being responsible for a feature (front and back-end), or with more time given, completely fleshing out features before even touching code and the whole team working on the same feature at one time.
+ Challenges
  + MERGE CONFLICTS
  + A personal challenge is for me to get more familiar with Bootstrap, cuz HTML forms... ugh
+ d3.js is super cool, but very dense!
